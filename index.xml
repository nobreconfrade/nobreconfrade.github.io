      <description>Hello, my name is William Pereira and I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Developer. The intent of this blog is to post some of my personal experiences and share my knowledge with people from around the world.
Talking a little about me I like to think that I&amp;rsquo;m in a continuous search for my purpose in the world, either it would be working as a dev and writing chronicles about day-to-day knowledge or talking about my hobbies.</description>

      <description>Since I started to think about the possibility of having a blog, I thought that the only use of it out be to post content as a catalog for people to see my work. Ultimately this is still a goal, but I had thoughts of writing a little about me and my hobbies. So for this post I want to right about one of my most beloved passions, video games.</description>
