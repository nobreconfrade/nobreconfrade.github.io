              <p>Since I started to think about the possibility of having a blog, I thought that
the only use of it out be to post content as a catalog for people to see my
work. Ultimately this is still a goal, but I had thoughts of writing a little
about me and my hobbies. So for this post I want to right about one of my most
beloved passions, video games.</p>
<p>I have no fear of saying that games have changed my life, not only by teaching
me a lot of things and making a awesome top of conversation on
school/college/work break but also the way I think, the way I talk, the way
I see people and how I interact with them. Video games are as such as powerful
art form as a movie, or music or any other but they let you be completely
immerse on the experience, riding you on a boat throw a river of deep down
emotions, irresponsible and careless joy or even technological astonishment.
Simply put, they have a potential only limited by the mind of those who make
them.</p>
<p>But there is an episode of my life that I remember, specifically, that made
me in completely awe with this world, a long time ago when I was still very
young&hellip; I used to go with my mother in a video game rental of my neighbor,
it was a small shop with (in that time) three Playstations One and a Super
Nintendo. I had a Super Nintendo myself so I got there time to time to rent
a new game and this time was no different. That occasion was special since
the owner was in a good mood he let the boys rent three games by the price
of one and for me that was great news! I picked up the two games that I had
in mind on the bench and, since I had another one to choose, I took my time
to get the last. The problem is that my mother wasn&rsquo;t really in a patient
mood so I had to do it in a rush. Giving a quick look at the shelf of games
one called my attention, it had a robot-looking thing shooting a giant dragon
with a cannon in the place of the arm! What a joyful game it should be, of
course I literally knew nothing about it but what should I say, it was free
in the end. Took it to the cashier and got home, played the games and eventually I put this new game on my Nintendo. As far as my game tasty goes nowadays I think I was pretty lucky back then.</p>
<p><img src="/post_imgs/the_very_beginning/super_metroid_cover.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>My initial thoughts however was that Super Metroid was a normal game, you don&rsquo;t
see a masterpiece as it is by playing for some minutes when your around 10 years
old. Although the 2D side scrolling platform was a well known POV in the 16 bits
generation with very expressive titles, I wasn&rsquo;t used to 2D shooters so my first
impression was of a shooting game, blow up some bad guys! But I hadn&rsquo;t much
background so I couldn&rsquo;t think of much else. The initial parts of the game as
well are plenty linear, not until you get to Brinstar the player starts to know
were he&rsquo;s putting his hours in. When you get to that part, you start realizing
that there is much more than simply shooting, the area that was more or less
caves changes to a much more vivid, flora-wise rich environment with a more
upbeat music. You now is presented with a much larger area that have some rooms
you can&rsquo;t access until much later in the game. You do see some blocks on your
path with strange symbols that don&rsquo;t break with you current equipment, they are
only there to tease you with mystery.</p>
<p>You keep up the game, gain some new powers like the super missile, high jump
boots and even uncovers a new area, Norfair. The game simply put shows the
player pieces of the world, those pieces need to be mastered to eventually
mount the bigger puzzle that Zebes is. And soon after that, after getting the
ice beam, the game shows it full potential. I remember struggling a lot in my
first Super Metroid run, as it was my first Metroidvania title. But I do
remember as well the joy of discovery that the game provides, there was nothing
like it. Watching Samus getting stronger and stronger at each power up to the point
where in late game initial area enemies were nothing was very satisfying.
This gets to an point where you can even <em>walk through lava!</em> That was so awesome
back them. This kind of power wasn&rsquo;t displayed to the player as number on an
RPG character, but the player could feel it as he progress the game, it&rsquo;s
something natural that simply couldn&rsquo;t be exposed with numbers on the Super
Metroid atmosphere. There are ways to mix those mechanics in a good and sweet
style, but it would require a little more sugar to the recipe.</p>
<p>And the backtracking, don&rsquo;t even let me get started. The world design was
made in a sense that it let you memorize all the world sections really
easily, were each section have a specific characteristic that the player
can rely on. For example, Crateria is this big convoluted mix of caverns and
over world mostly brown and gray, Maridia is an area with maritime creatures
and flooded by water, Norfair is a big pit of lava with a lot of red color and
so goes on. That is a common trend between Super and the other Metroid entries.
This design decision let players make a mental map of power ups and places to
use them in ways that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible if all the map was, let&rsquo;s say,
a big city of concrete with look alike buildings. Those little details made
an incredible difference between playing the game and don&rsquo;t get into pit roles
where the player don&rsquo;t find an exit and in the end, let him have a very smooth
experience.</p>
<p>All those factors lead me to complete awe with this series, such as I still
play Super Metroid to this day and it doesn&rsquo;t feel dated at all. I still
recommend it to my friends that are looking for a strong game in it core,
it main mechanics. There are other factors that I could have mentioned but
the idea isn&rsquo;t to make a full review of the game, but tell a little of my
history with a game that certainly changed the way I played games beyond that
point.</p>
<hr>
<p>The history doesn&rsquo;t end here. If Super Metroid told me of the possibilities of
a deep, well elaborated game mechanic, there was another entry on the series
that showed me the marvelous of technological achievement and that no game
can only work in a certain era, you just need a new perspective in old ideas.</p>
<p>See you in part 2!</p>
